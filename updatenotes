Special thanks to "paddydoyle"
 slightly more pythonic way of getting $HOME and $USER
specifically:
- replace the awk of /etc/passwd with os.path.expanduser('~') (this is a
  cross-platform way of getting the home dir)
- replace whoami with getpass.getuser() (this is a cross-platform way of
  getting the username)


Reorganize the git repository
